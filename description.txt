A simple addon for TeaNPC, adding a reworked varient of the endgame boss, The Sky Colossus.
Currently as TeaNPC hasn't published stable build, the boss adapts to vanilla Terraria and has no loots.

TODO:
	-[]Add boss loot corresponding to original TeaNPC.
	-[]Add judgement cut.
	-[]Adapt damage and health values to TeaNPC
